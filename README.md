## **Introduction to Machine Learning**
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from and make decisions based on data. Itâ€™s widely used in various industries to automate tasks, improve decision-making processes, and predict outcomes.

## **Types of Machine Learning Models**

### **Supervised Learning**
Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, which means that each training example is paired with an output label. The model learns to predict the label based on the input data.

**Examples**:
- **Regression**: Predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices).
- **Classification**: Predicting categorical labels (e.g., spam detection).

### **Unsupervised Learning**
Unsupervised learning involves training a model on data without labeled responses. The model tries to learn the patterns and the structure from the input data.

**Examples**:
- **Clustering**: Grouping data into clusters (e.g., customer segmentation).
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the number of variables under consideration (e.g., PCA).

### **Reinforcement Learning**
Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions and receiving rewards or penalties.

**Examples**:
- **Q-Learning**: An agent-based learning algorithm where an agent learns to achieve a goal in an uncertain, potentially complex environment.

## **Implemented Models**

### **Linear Regression**
Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. It assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (X) and the single output variable (Y). The model aims to find the best-fitting line through the data points that minimize the error between the predicted and actual values.

**Dataset**: California Housing Dataset

**Key Concepts**:
- **Gradient Descent**: An optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function by iteratively updating the parameters.
- **Cost Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used to measure the performance of the model.

For more details, refer to the [Linear Regression implementation](implement.py).

### **Logistic Regression**
Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification problems. It predicts the probability that a given input point belongs to a certain class, typically using the sigmoid function to map predicted values to probabilities.

**Dataset**: Breast Cancer Dataset

**Key Concepts**:
- **Sigmoid Function**: Converts the input value into a probability ranging between 0 and 1.
- **Gradient Descent**: Used to find the optimal parameters that minimize the cost function.
- **Cost Function**: Logarithmic loss is used as the cost function to measure the error in predictions.
